        <img src="owl.jpg" alt="owl">

        <p>I recently moved from Milwaukee, WI because there was a winter where we received 120 days of below freezing weather.  My girlfriend and I could no longer stand the temperature, and decided to move in the middle of the winter.</p>

        <p>I have two dogs that work with me in my office.  Well at least one when I'm all day.  The other only comes and visits when I am eating lunch at my desk.</p>
